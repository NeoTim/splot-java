Splot Monitoring and Control Protocol (SMCP)
============================================

SMCP is an experimental RESTful machine-to-machine/thing-to-thing
protocol designed for monitoring and controlling networked devices, as
well as automating direct machine-to-machine interactions. SMCP can be
used via either CoAP or HTTP.
