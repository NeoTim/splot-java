## Primitives

Splot Automation Primitives are themselves Things, meaning they can be
created and then configured in-band just like any other Thing.

Splot currently defines three types of “standard” automation
primitives:

*   Pairings
*   Rules
*   Timers

Ultimately, the automation primitives described here are experimental.
There is always room for improvement and changes in behavior should be
expected until the protocol stabilizes.
