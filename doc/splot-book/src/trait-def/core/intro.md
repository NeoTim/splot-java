# Core Traits

The `core` Splot traits are traits that are fundamental to Splot. There are
currently just four:

 * [`Base`](./base.md): Descriptive metadata, Traps, Hidden flag, Context Info
 * [`Group`](./group.md): All groups of things implement this trait.
 * [`Scene`](./scene.md): For things that support scenes.
 * [`Transition`](./transition.md): For things that support smooth state transitions.
